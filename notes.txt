Deployment Notes for Google Cloud in frontend

Make sure you have gcloud installed on your machine in order to link the google account your project is in
Once installed, authorize the account by doing "gcloud auth login" - This allows you to link your google account to the project
Also make sure on your Google Cloud Platform you have created your project because you have to link it to gcloud like this

"gcloud config set project <projectName>"

docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/josh-portfolio-446311/josh-codes/frontend .
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/josh-portfolio-446311/josh-codes/frontend

josh-portfolio-446311 is your GCP project
josh-codes is your artifact name
 frontend is the path your docker image will be pushed to
